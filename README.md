# Steam Game Discount Probability Prediction Model

## Overview

A machine learning model to forecast the likelihood of a video game being discounted on the Steam platform.

## Data

Data was Web scraped from SteamDB and exported from Kaggle. 

## Model

An XGBoost model that displayed the distribution of probable possibilities for a video game sale. The selected features for the model were selected ratings, positive ratio, final price, original price, and discount amount. 

## Evaluation

At the moment of the project, it is not likely a game would go on sale based on the metrics we have used for the XGBoost model
